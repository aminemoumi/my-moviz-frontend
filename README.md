# MyMoviz - Frontend

Mymoviz is a project that was made using React and Next JS during my Web Developper coding bootcamp at La Capsule, Paris. 

It is a website that displays the latest big releases dynamically by communicating with the Movie Database's API.

It allows the user to rate, like, and add a view count to each film.

API: [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
